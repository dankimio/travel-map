# Travel Map

Travel Map is a web app that allows you to create a map of the world, marking countries you have visited. Once a country is clicked, it is highlighted in a different colour, indicating that it has been visited. The resulting map can be shared with friends, allowing them to see the user's travel history. This project is a fun and interactive way to keep track of one's travels and share them with others.
